                            "Vital materialists will thus try to linger in those moments during
                            which they find themselves fascinated by objects, taking them as clues 
                            to the material vitality that they share with them. This sense of a strange
                            and incomplete commonality with the out-side may induce vital materialists
                            to treat nonhumans - animals, plants, earth, even artifacts and commodities
                            - more carefully, more strategically, more ecologically."
